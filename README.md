# LCS Recomp

GTA: Liberty City Stories PC port, built on [PSPRecomp](https://github.com/jessicanataliagta/PSPRecomp). Game files not included.

## Setup

Requires the US v1.05 release (ULUS-10041).

Place your decrypted `EBOOT.ELF` and the disc's `PSP_GAME` folder in `game/` for the [release](https://github.com/elmasas/lcs-recomp/releases/latest), or in `lcs/game/` when building from source.

## Build

Requires Visual Studio 2022 and LLVM (clang-cl).

```text
lcs\BUILD_LCS.bat
```

## Play

```text
lcs\PLAY_LCS.bat
```

Settings are in `lcs/config/LCSNative.ini`.

`Display.ResolutionMode` is the window (`PSP`, `Scale`, `Custom`, or
`Desktop`). `Rendering.InternalResolutionMode` is the GE render
target, with the same four choices. `Desktop` uses the monitor on
Windows and on Linux. `Rendering.TextureLodBias` shifts texture mip
selection; negative values keep textures sharper at a distance.

## Mouse and keyboard

Edit `[Controls]` in `lcs/config/LCSNative.ini`, then restart. A
binding is one or more names separated by commas. `None` clears it.
`Shift`, `Ctrl`, and `Alt` set both sides. The accepted names are
commented in that file. F10 opens host settings. F11 toggles
fullscreen. Moving the mouse looks around. A controller button
takes the same action names.

| Binding | Default | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MoveForward` | W | On foot, move forward. In a vehicle, accelerate. |
| `MoveBack` | S | On foot, move back. In a vehicle, brake. |
| `MoveLeft` | A | Move or steer left. |
| `MoveRight` | D | Move or steer right. |
| `Walk` | Left Alt | Shorter steps. |
| `Sprint` | Space | Run on foot. Not sent in a vehicle. |
| `Jump` | Left Shift, Right Shift | Jump. In a vehicle the game reads this as the brake. |
| `Attack` | Left mouse button | Attack or fire. |
| `Aim` | Right mouse button | Aim on foot. Not sent in a vehicle. |
| `CenterCamera` | H, middle mouse button | Put the camera behind you. Also picks up a weapon. |
| `EnterVehicle` | F, Enter | Enter or exit a vehicle. |
| `WeaponPrevious` | Q, Left, wheel up | Previous weapon. In a vehicle, previous radio station. |
| `WeaponNext` | E, Right, wheel down | Next weapon. In a vehicle, next radio station. |
| `Up` | Up | Toggle a special mission. In a vehicle, also pitches up. |
| `Down` | Down | D-pad down. In a vehicle, horn and pitch down. |
| `Pause` | Escape | Pause. |
| `Camera` | V | Change camera. |
| `Handbrake` | Space | Handbrake in a vehicle. |

Controller names follow the Xbox layout. On a PlayStation pad, A is
Cross, B is Circle, X is Square, and Y is Triangle. `LeftStick` and
`RightStick` are `Move` or `Camera`. A trigger does not send its
buttons in a vehicle; accelerate and brake still apply.

| Button | Default | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A / Cross | `Sprint` | Run. Also sent in a vehicle. |
| B / Circle | `Attack` | Attack or fire. |
| X / Square | `Jump` | In a vehicle the game reads this as the brake. |
| Y / Triangle | `EnterVehicle` | Enter or exit a vehicle. |
| LB / L1 | `CenterCamera` | Puts the camera behind you. Also picks up a weapon. |
| RB / R1 | `Aim` | Aim. In a vehicle, the handbrake. |
| LT / L2 | `MoveBack`, `CenterCamera` | Brake. On foot, also centers the camera. |
| RT / R2 | `MoveForward`, `Aim` | Accelerate. On foot, also aims. |
| D-pad left | `WeaponPrevious` | Previous weapon. In a vehicle, the previous radio station. |
| D-pad right | `WeaponNext` | Next weapon. In a vehicle, the next radio station. |
| D-pad up | `Up` | Special mission. |
| D-pad down | `Down` | Horn in a vehicle. |
| Start | `Pause` | Pause. |
| Back / Share | `Camera` | Change camera. |
| Left stick | `Move` | Movement. `LeftStick` swaps this with the camera. |
| Right stick | `Camera` | Camera. |
| Left stick click | `Down` | Horn in a vehicle. |
| Right stick click | `None` | `PadRightStickClick`. |

## Linux

The native build uses Vulkan for the GE and SDL2 for the window and
audio. It needs `glslangValidator`, plus the Vulkan, SDL2, and FFmpeg
development packages. The Linux build also compiles a small tool that
packs `lcs/host/font5x7.txt` into the F10 menu font. The Windows build
does not run that step.

```text
lcs/scripts/build_linux.sh
lcs/scripts/play_linux.sh
```

That build compiles `lcs/host/vulkan/ge.vert` and `ge.frag` to SPIR-V
with `glslangValidator`. Editing either shader rebuilds it into
`LCSNative`.

`lcs/config/LCSNative.ini` is shared with Windows, so the checked-in
setting stays `Backend=DirectX12`. On Linux that value selects the
Vulkan GE. `Backend=Vulkan` selects it explicitly, and any other
backend name keeps the software rasterizer. `LCS_VULKAN_VALIDATION=1`
turns on the Khronos validation layer and prints its warnings and
errors.

## Docker
You also can utilize [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build the Linux version.

```bash
cd docker
./build.sh

Available options:

        archlinux       compile the source code on Arch Linux
        debian          compile the source code on Debian

Usage: ./build.sh <option>
```

That way you will get a pre-confugred build environment which also utilzes [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) for faster building times.

## Unattended engine stress test

Build first, then run a ten-minute test without keyboard or controller input:

```bash
python3 lcs/scripts/stress_test.py --seconds 600
```

The runner loads a disposable copy of your existing saves, copies your settings,
checks that the original save contents stay unchanged, and kills the process if
it exceeds the deadline. It leaves logs in `out/stress/<timestamp>/`. Your current
render settings are used; this is suitable for exercising increased draw distance,
population, and resolution without editing the configuration.

The character runs, turns, jumps, and sweeps the camera. Position samples detect
obstacles and trigger backing up and turning. Add `--driving` to attempt to enter
nearby vehicles and drive; that run only succeeds if driving movement is actually
observed. This is exploration, so it does not guarantee a particular route or
mission completion. Game menus suspend movement and receive cancel pulses to escape incidental
save prompts. The test fails if gameplay cannot
start within 120 seconds, movement stays blocked for 60 seconds, or gameplay is
unavailable for 120 seconds.

Test mode rejects **all guest file writes**, write-capable file opens, and save
or delete operations. Existing saves can still be read. The runner adds isolation
as a second protection. It never asks the game to save.

Artifacts include `runtime.log`, `movement.csv`, `summary.json`, and `runner.json`
(with peak resident memory and the save comparison). Movement success requires
at least five moving samples and ten game units of travel, plus a normal timed
stop. Presentation interval statistics include startup/loading and are not GPU
render timings. PPM screenshots are captured every 15 seconds with software or
GPU readback presentation; direct Vulkan/DX12 swapchain presentation has no CPU
pixels and does not produce these screenshots.

You can also use the native options on Linux or Windows:

```text
LCSNative --game <game-root> --stress-test --max-seconds 600 --stress-output <new-output-directory>
LCSNative --game <game-root> --stress-driving --max-seconds 1800 --stress-output <new-output-directory>
```

Native test mode blocks saving, but only the Python runner copies saves and
configuration. Native runs default to 600 seconds if no duration is supplied.
Exit code 0 means the run completed and movement was verified; 2 means incomplete
coverage, startup/recovery failure, or an abnormal engine stop.
